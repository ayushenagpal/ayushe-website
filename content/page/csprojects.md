### Procter & Gamble - **Olay Super Bowl LIV Intern**

#### January - February 2020

I had the incredible opportunity to be one of 7 out of 185,000 Girls Who Code members and work with Olay's team to build landing pages as a part of their Super Bowl LIV Campaign, #MakeSpaceForWomen. Olay partnered with Girls Who Code in a mission to close the gender gap and change the image of a "programmer". Through this paid internship, I was able to be a part of the Super Bowl campaign and the team that designed the web pages from idea to completion linked below and raised $250,000 for Girls Who Code!
