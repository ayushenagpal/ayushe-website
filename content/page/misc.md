## SASR - **Mentor & Tutor Program Founder**

2012 - Present
My work with SASR started when I was a mere 9 years old. Tagging along with my mom, I'd spend hours after school working with students with special needs as a mentor and a friend. During that time I co-organized a picnic for students that attended the SASR center and underprivileged children in India. Since then, I've continued my work with them even after moving across the world. I started a program the summer before my junior year to teach English and computer skills to students with special needs in India virtually.

Speech and Debate Team - **Event Leader**

September 2017 - April 2021
This year I am the Event Leader of Interpretation, leading a group of over 20 students. Although this year looks different, I am making an effort to give my teammates as well as myself the most authentic Speech & Debate season as I can. From teaching new students the basics, to helping improve varsity members, I help others be the best people and competitors they can. 
In my junior year, as the Middle School Enrichment Officer for the team, I created and executed an 8-week program for over 70 students to teach them the basics of speech and debate. Through this, I raised over $4000 to fund the high school competitive team. This same year, I was also a quarter-finalist at the state tournament and the second runner up at the national qualifying tournament.
In my 3 years on the team, I've qualified to the State tournament every year but I've also spent a week each summer teaching at the annual Speak Week--a rigorous public speaking camp for local 3rd-8th graders.
