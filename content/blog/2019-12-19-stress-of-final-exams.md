Moving from across the world, my expectations for an American high school were... well - High School Musical. Lots of singing and dancing. A star athlete falling in love with a nerdy me. My Troy Bolton sweeping me off my feet. Students huddled in cliques worrying about the dress they’re wearing to prom 5 months early and gossiping about who the Prom Queen will be. However, my expectations did not live up to reality, as they don’t in most cases. 

<!---more--->

Going into your freshman year, you expected to get a 4.0 throughout high school and get accepted into UCLA away from all the “Mason” kids. But you end up at UC with a 3.2 and half of Mason’s graduates.

My high school life has been nothing but revolving around school - worrying about the seven hundred essays and four hundred fifty-one projects I have due in the next 2 days. Being extremely stressed all the time has become normalized. We compete for less amount of sleep and more amount of stress. After an exhausting night of staying up to study, the next morning I complained about how I got four and a half hours of sleep the night before, I hear someone snap back and say “I got three you can stop complaining”. Well, good for you Karen.

During the final exam season, there is one particular website everyone seems to be studying on - Rogerhub Final Grade Calculator. When you need a 157% on the final exam to get an A, it’s a good sign you should give up on it.

When it comes to the test you realize all the hours of studying you did when you could’ve been sleeping went to waste when the only blank you can fill on the test is “Your name”. As people start turning their papers in, you’re not sure if people are finishing fast or just giving up before you. The academic value of final exams is not worth the stress and consequences of unhealthy coping mechanisms students experience while preparing for them.
But we are all in this together with final exams.
