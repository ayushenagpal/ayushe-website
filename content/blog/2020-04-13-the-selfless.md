A crisis brings out the best and worst in people. Throughout this situation we have seen people self-sacrificing on the front lines and we have seen people ignorantly exposing themselves in the name of demanding their rights. One echoes of bravery and humanity at its best. The other is conceited and foolish.

At a time like this, health care workers all over the world are being burnt out while risking lives but the worst is yet to come. Health care workers are at an especially high risk of catching the corona virus, because of their prolonged exposure to patients who have it and thousands of them have already contracted it. But they didn't sign up for such a dangerous job. At the same time, they are carrying tremendous responsibilities of lives on the brink of death. Our healthcare workers are seeing deaths and suffering like they have never seen before. They grieve each death with a sense of responsibility at not having been able to save the person. As a health care worker some people think they should be immune to this. And they’re not. No one got in the field to do a bad job. Sometimes people forget they’re human too. They are struggling to keep up as hospitals overflow with patients. All of them bear the responsibility of looking after patients as they suffer while facing the struggles and stresses everyone at home does with the pandemic at the same time. Yet, they show up. They put their life on the line. They continue to radiate compassion despite the fears they bear. 

When their 16 hour traumatic shifts come to an end, they beg. They beg us to do our part of staying home. The essential workers in our society -- from doctors and nurses to grocery store cashiers and truck drivers -- need the rest of us to stay home. By disregarding the order, we are making their difficult tasks even worse. They are the real heroes of our day. But they need us to help minimize their workload and their anxiety level. If there’s any other time we should all have compassion for each other, it’s right now. 

A second wave is occurring in Europe and we in the U.S. do well to learn from what they are experiencing. Officials in Europe thought they were past the worst of the illness and reopened stores and venues. Here in the U.S. we are still in the height of the "curve" and states are reopening work as usual. We need to look to Europe's experience and learn from their mistakes. Their (so-thought) “successful” fight against COVID-19 may have led to some complacency -- at least, on our part in thinking our risk was decreasing. People dodge the fear of the virus by finding relief in comparing COVID-19 to the ordinary flu. 

News reports emerge of huge crowds protesting against corona virus lock downs in State Capitols. Even with young children holding signs that say, “my constitutional rights are essential”. Those protesting are endangering their lives and the lives of others but don’t understand that there are no rights when there is no you anymore. Soon, images of a group of protesters driving with signs being faced off by a nurse standing in front of their vehicle surfaced. That photo was a powerful example of the contrast in people during this pandemic. The selfless and the selfish. The front line worker and the protester. The self-sacrificing one and the fabricated self-rights seeker. Humanity at its worst is disheartening. Humanity at its best is inspiring.
