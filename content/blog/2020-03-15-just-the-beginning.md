One month ago, the corona virus was something that was happening somewhere else. It came to us sooner than we expected and stronger than we expected. While we worked on our work in class, my teacher put the live stream of the governor up in class as speculations of school being closed for the school year traveled fast.

And of course, my class watched the governor intently with a common hope to hear that schools would be closed in an effort to slow down the corona virus. We knew it was that serious that school would be canceled for weeks because of that terror. Alas, the bell rang and we didn’t get to hear the rest of that. Later that day, the school had posted an update after instructions from the governor hat we would have a 3-week spring break. The timeliness of this well-deserved (or as I claim so) break came as a relief as well as a surprise to me.

But as these days pass by slower than the previous it dawns upon me that I already have a lack of interaction with people but on top of that, we all think it is dangerous to step out of the house like the air outside has corona in it. This fear wasn’t instilled when I was going to school and in an arm’s length of a student vigorously sneezing a day ago. All of a sudden everything has changed. I take a shower to get out of my pajamas only to wear my pajamas for that night because I know I won’t be leaving the house. There doesn’t feel to be a purpose like I did for school. Amidst this fear and chaos, we have recognized the halt that this world has come to with this virus and the absence of our daily routine.

Personally, for me, this break has given me the chance to open up my schedule for things I love to do. Things that I find so engaging that they make me lose all track of time. However, for many others its become a restriction in their minds and it’s like we wonder what we talked about before the corona virus. But this may be something we will be talking about for the next few months but this is just the beginning of something that may become our new norm for a while. Until then - stay safe and stay healthy!
